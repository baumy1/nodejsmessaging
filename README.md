# Node JS Messaging
This project originally started out as me testing a playing around with Heroku but grew and evolved into me learning and experimenting further with Node, Sockets IO and Express. The drawing section always colabrative drawing across multiple browsers and uses P5.js to handle the canvas functionality, Sockets.io for the socket and express-fileupload to handle uploading the background image. The 'messaging' feature is underdeveloped and is again more of me playing around and trying to learn. 

The drawing section was adapted from [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) from his (WebSockets and p5.js Tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjULmG8fqc8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6b36TzJidYfIYwTFEq3K5qH]

## Enjoy :)
